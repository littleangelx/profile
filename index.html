        <div class="main-text">I'm Rachel and although my undergraduate degree was in mathematics, I have been learning to code over the past few years in my spare time. At first I concentrated on Python, in particular on data science/AI. However, I have since branched out into the world of web development and I must say I'm loving it...</div><br>
        <div class="main-text">I currently work part-time at <a href="https://allsaints.church" class="link">All Saints Church</a> in Hoole, Chester (where I live), and am responsible for updating their website and <a href="https://churchsuite.com" class="link">ChurchSuite</a>, a church management system. I enjoy my job and love the people I work with as well as the whole church family and the local community we seek to serve.</div>
